  - Just a link to a 3rd party application (for now)
  
## other info

I've started this project as a way to exercise and learn how the algorithms work.   
No libraries have been used for algorithms and user-interface, that's why the first may be inefficient and the second looks kinda ugly.   
The random word generator is form an open source program, it looks like a hmm.
