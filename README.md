## Other info

I've started this project as a way to exercise and learn how these algorithms work.   
No libraries have been used for algorithms and user-interface, that's why the first may be (they really are) inefficient and the second looks kinda ugly.   
The random word generator is a [open source piece of code](https://gist.github.com/swenzel/70beac153cdf23803f89), it works similarly to a HMM.
