## About this project

A site, hosted by github, with collection of applications meant to be usefull while studying for the Bioinformatics Algotithms course (Computer Science Engineering at polimi).

This project started as a way to personally experiment using some of the algorithm studied during the course, and later became a place to exercise in UX. 

## Available applications

- Burrow Wheeler 
  - Transform
  - Rotations
  - Reverse transform
  - Occurencies table and cumulative index
  - Inexact matching
- Sequence Alignment
  - Global alignment
  - Local alignment
- Hierholzer   
  - supports directional and non-directional graphs
  - Gui graph generator
  - Hierholzer Eulerian path and circle finder
  - Boolean txt matrix generator (usefull for a third party application)
- Multiple Sequence alignment
  - Global msa profile
  - GUI manual guide-tree builder
  - Textual representation of the tree

  
- Tries 
  - Just a link to a 3rd party application (for now)
