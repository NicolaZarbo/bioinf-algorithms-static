# Bioniformatics algorithms

A collection of applications meant to be usefull for the study for the bioinformatics course (computer science engineering at polimi).

[=> The application <=](https://nicolazarbo.github.io/bioinf-html-js-algorithms/)
This project started as a way to experiment and try using some of the algorithm studied during the course, and later became a place to exercise in UX. 

## Available calculators

- Burrow Wheeler 
  - Transform
  - Rotations
  - Reverse transform
  - Occurencies table and cumulative index
  - Inexact matching
- Sequence Alignment
  - Global alignment
  - Local alignment
- Bruijn(not completed) graphs   
(Working in progress, doesn't work with strings yet)
  - supports directional and non-directional graphs
  - Gui graph generator
